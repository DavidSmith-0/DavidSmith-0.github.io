## 🛠️ How It Works
- Hosted automatically by GitHub Pages (branch: `main`, folder: `/ (root)`)  
- Contact form is ready to connect with [Formspree](https://formspree.io)  
- Payments button ready to integrate with [Stripe](https://stripe.com)

## ✨ Next Steps
1. Customize the text, colors, and branding in `index.html` and `styles.css`.  
2. Replace the placeholder Formspree endpoint in `script.js` with your own.  
3. Update the Stripe Checkout link in the **Pricing** section.  
4. Swap the logo/hero images in `assets/` with your own designs.
